# Voyager2-Animation
Animation of Voyager2 Space Probe using python

On August, the 20th, 1997, The National Aeronautical and Space 
Administration (NASA) launched Voyager 2, a space probe to travel through 
space and study the planets. During its journey through the solar system, Voyager 
2 left earth, visited Mars as well as the four gas Giants and discovered and 
photographed the moons of these planets.
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) maintains a web service and 
online database called "Horizons", which contains the data for the flight path 
(trajectory) of Voyager 2 on its journey through solar system.
The period travelled includes several gravity - assists (sling - shot 
maneuvers) as the probe passed by the larger planets. 
The data provided by Horizons gives the X and Y coordinates of the gas 
Giants and that of the trajectory of the Voyager.

Aim of the Project.

The aim of the project is to use the data provided by the Horizons web service to 
create an Animation depicting the trajectory/path of voyager 2 as it journeys 
through the solar system over a period of 22 years.

A descriptive moveable graphical representation 
(animation) was created using Matplotlib and Numpy python packages, where
the trajectory of voyager2 space probe for a period of 22 years since it began its 
journey from earth was successfully exhibited in the animation.
Voyager2 can be seen moving through the solar system from earth to the last of 
the Gas-Giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) and its gravity-assists 
(sling-shots) are seen as it enters each planetâ€™s orbit using the data extracted from 
the JPL web service.
